This file is a small test, but the system is configured to handle:
- Files up to 500MB in size
- Text with hundreds of thousands of characters
- Multiple file uploads simultaneously
- Drag and drop anywhere on the webpage
- WebSocket message chunking for large content
- Automatic conversation saving to DynamoDB

The backend is now properly configured with:

- Proper IAM permissions
- WebSocket chunking on the frontend

All systems are operational and ready for large file processing.
